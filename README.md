### Description
DeepEye is a video surveillance application that runs on your idelling desktop computer. This project is inspired based on use cases of object detection using deep learning. There are two modes of detection; motion and object. The object detection backend uses SSD architecture and detects presence of human and pets. The code is open-source, feel free to modify for your own.
